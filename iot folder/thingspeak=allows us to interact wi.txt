wifi server port number is 80

const int LDR_PIN = 34; // Define the pin connected to the LDR
const int LED_PIN = 12; // Define the pin connected to the LED
void setup() {
pinMode(LDR_PIN, INPUT);
pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
int sensorValue = analogRead(LDR_PIN); // Read the LDR value (0-4095)
int brightness = map(sensorValue, 0, 4095, 0, 255); // Map to LED brightness

analogWrite(LED_PIN, brightness); // Set LED brightness
delay(100); // Add a small delay for stability
}
here in the above example 
4095 and 255 is just a random numbers whcich are used to declare the highest and lowest intensity of led bulb depending upon the suns radiation 
and these numbeers may vary according to the sun intensity of light or any other intensity of light source as it works on light dependent resistance its LDR
