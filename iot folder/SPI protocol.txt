SPI protocol
serial phaeripheral interface

four wire communicaation but in UART we make use of 2 wires 
synchronous type communication
single master, multi slave configuration
SPI is full duplex communication technology 
protocols= set of instructions
its used for short range communication


in master we have                                               in slave we have
 serial clock(SCLK)                                             serial clock(SCLK)
master output and slave input(MOSI)                            MOSI
master input slave output(MISO)                                MISO
slave selecting (SS)                                            SS


in case of 2 slaves   ss should be selected to grnd pin
if slave 1 ss is grounded then slave 1 is selected and vice versa
GPIO=seneral purpose input output pin


timing diagram 
if the readimgs of master data is unknown then slave will send N number of data bytes.


parameter sof configuring SPI protocols
> clock polarity 
> clock phase 

clock polarity (CPOL)

if cpol=0 then idle state is 0 and active state is 1
if cpol=1 then idle state is 1 ND ACTIVE STATE IS 

when the data has to be toggled by Tx 
when the data has to be sampled by Rx

CPHASE=0
data will be sampled at the leading edge of the clock (leading edge=firs edge of the pulse)(rise =  leading edge )

CPHASE1= 
data will be sampled at the trailing edge of the clock (trailing edge=second edge of the pulse) (fall= tariling edge)




SPI models
mode                CPOL               CPHASE                   COMMENT
mode 0              0                   0                active state clock is "1" data sampling at leading edge
mode 1              0                   1                active state clock is "1" data sampling at trailing edge
mode 2              1                   0                active state clock is "0" data sampling at leading edge
mode 3              1                   1                active state clock is "0" data sampling at trailing edge
