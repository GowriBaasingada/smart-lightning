A smart mirror, also known as a "magic mirror," is an interactive device powered by artificial intelligence that displays digital information such as weather updates, news, social media feeds, and calendar reminders alongside the reflection of the us

gartner 
the first thing happeneds in software is requirement gathering process
busnessrequiremnet >>> IT requiremnet

capture of requiremnt== individual technique and group requiremnt technique

function and non 
implicit and explicit


customer>>>needs==requiremnets

IT requiremnet sare called backlogs there comes to product owner
sprint=short duration of work
in agile the requirements are there in he form of use case
USE CASE =SEQUENCE
main flow and alternate flow=ex of ATM 



GIT



software is about 5 opearations CRUDL where C=create R=read U=update  D=delete             L=list(search ) in case of so many people with similar people
online/batch(group)

development environment>>>>>system integration (functional system requiremnet)
developers will always perform the unit test



LES/S=less endurance           security    UAT=user acceptance test

deefect =P1,P2<P3,P4 p=priority

extreeme programming in agile= where 2 or 3 developpers are sitting behimd and their duty is to handle the all the steps
